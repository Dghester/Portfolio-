  <p>Hi, my name is Danielle Hester!! I am a 21 year old creative born and raised in the city of Chicago. I am currently in my senior year at Columbia College Chicago, studying film and graphic design. Outside of school I am a licensed nail techinician looking to get her business up and running when the school year is over! My ultimate goal in life is to use my creative mind each and everyday within the video production, graphic design and nail technician industry. I would like to share my ideas and passion with others and learn all that I can. I do not limit myself; I want to learn and explore all the artistic possibilities within our world.</p>
