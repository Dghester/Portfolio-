As you may know the world's population is constantly growing at a 1.1% rate per year.  This means that the population is growing roughly about 83 million people annually, roughly 1.5 million people each week, or about 220,000 people per day. This is equivalent to about 9,000 or more people every hour, or 150 more people per minute. Growing from 1 billion in the 1800's to more than 8.1 billion now in 2024. With this very rapid population growth, “demographers expect the world population to peak by the end of this century” (ourworldindata.com).

While some may overlook this information it should be noted that information like this tells the future. Since our human activity is continuously growing this means that Earth’s resources are constantly diminishing. With “the overconsumption of natural resources like forests, water, and minerals exceeding the planet's ability to replenish them, leading to environmental degradation and potential future shortages if not addressed effectively; this means we are using more resources than the Earth can regenerate, essentially "spending" the planet's natural capital faster than it can be replenished” (DepletionStatics).
