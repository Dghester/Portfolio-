<p> The first time I can remember the internet was when I was in preschool. They had a number of programs to help us learn our ABC’s or numbers. However, it wasn’t as if I was the one navigating through it like Wagner and her dad. The preschool teachers just put it on a program, explained what we were to do and just let us go at it. The main website that I can remember them going to was Starfall. A website “founded by Dr. Stephen Schutz…motivated to create a learning platform with untimed, multisensory interactive games that allow children to see, hear, and touch as they learn” (Starfall.com).  That was truly the start of my “internet journey.” Now unlike Wagner, I was born in 2003. Around the time when I started using the internet, it was not something fairly new. Like Wagner mentioned, things like Myspace were out or coming out. The internet was a fairly common thing that everyone knew how to navigate through or learned fairly quickly. For example, after a while teachers slowly started to teach us how to navigate through the internet on our own. </p>

   
<p>Although, (like I have heard many of the older people around me say) I do feel as though the internet can almost be a disadvantage to generations now if not used correctly. I know you may have heard people say it will rot your brain. For example, because of the internet's constant development, it has AI that is able to write essays for students — or AI that may potentially take over some jobs in the future. The internet also has made it easier for everyone to access a variety of different information. With the internet tracking done by companies, there are now ad’s and information being programmed to be shown based on your search history. Like Wagner mentioned, “It’s true that Facebook controls your data; meanwhile, you control not a single element of Facebook.” </p>  
    
<p> 
Truly unfortunate, but let’s take this conversation in another direction. Wagner said, “For example, I open my Instagram account to post on my Instagram Story feed that I’m writing this essay about internet nostalgia. There I can attach kitschy gifs to my story like fancy stickers—I look at my options, and the offerings remind me of various moments from my online past. There’s an image of sparkles that takes me back to the flash-based dress-up games I once played as a tween. There’s another gif with glitzy text that reads “Don’t hate me cuz I’m beautiful,” recalling the emotional trials of my Myspace days. And there is yet another gif that features a computer that bears a suspicious resemblance to the “My Computer” icon from Windows 95. These gifs come from Giphy, which has been integrated with Instagram for years. They’re lo-res, imperfect, and entirely decontextualized. These disembodied ghosts—ancient in computer years—blink back at me because tech companies know that, based on my age, I like them. And I do like them. I miss where they came from—it’s a place I’ve found is no longer there.” </p>

<p>
I really like this paragraph because it’s highlighting how there is almost like a borrowing system when it comes to creating something new. For example, when a new app is made, they may say well what do people like. They may draw the conclusions of what people like from another source. This source then may be borrowed from or adjusted to fit the new app's vision or goal. Another case may just be something getting old, but some aspects of it can still  live on like the gifs from Windows 95. It just shows how the internet is constantly developing, but also keeping the old internet in mind while doing so. </p>
