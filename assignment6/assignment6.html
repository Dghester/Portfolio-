    <h1>Even Stephen King Is Scared of Clowns by Shawn Van Horn </h1> 
</header>
    
<p> Stephen King has always known what scares us, because it scares him too. In a 2017 interview with Yahoo, King put it simply: King went on to explain that if he was a sick kid in a hospital and a clown came into his room to cheer him up, he’d be scared to death. Kids are scared of clowns. If adults have that fear, imagine how terrifying it is for a child, whose brains are still learning and don’t understand their surroundings as well as an adult does. A grown-up knows their fear of clowns is silly, that this white-faced person isn’t going to attack them, but a child might really think that a clown is going to hurt them. </p>
    
<p>During a 2013 event with Nicole Schröder, King explained how Pennywise in <i>It</i>  came to be. He discussed that he wanted to write a book that had all the classic monsters in it, but decided he wanted one creature so scary that you scream just to look at it. King said, “So I thought to myself, ‘What scares children more than anything else in the world?’ And the answer was ‘clowns.’ In a 2005 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, King spoke of the fear kids have of seeing clowns at the circus, saying, “Their faces were dead white, their mouths were red, as though they were full of blood, they’re all screaming, their eyes are huge. What’s not to like?”</p>

  <h1>Coulrophobia</h1>  
</header>
    
    

 <p>In honor of Halloween coming up soon, I thought the perfect excerpt would be Stephen King expressing his outlook on his famous film and book <i>It</i>. More specifically, he’s discussing why he decided to go with a clown as one of his most famous terrifying creatures to scare all. His main reason being the fact that many people are already afraid of clowns in their most natural state. The phobia being called coulrophobia, causes anyone with a fear of clowns to have irrational reactions when they view one. This may include sweating, a racing heart, anxiety and or nausea. All of these things being the key components that make a scary movie successful for most. 
</p>
    
    
<p>Although, I just want to take the time to highlight how clowns have been highlighted as scary for many years in films and real life. I just remember hearing about how people were wearing clown masks and taking children in white vans when I was little.  Then, watching the film <i>The Killer Klowns from Outer Space </i>(1988) as a little girl — to films now like the <i>Terrifier</i> and <i>Stitches</i>. It makes me wonder how far into history will clowns being portrayed as scary go on. Will it be as long as people have coulrophobia? Will the fear of clowns ever get old? I guess not if films like <i>It</i> continue to exist — right?
