    <p>Hi, welcome to my website! Come and grab a drink with us! Would you believe me if I told you, I knew nothing about web design before creating this website!? Well, itâ€™s true. This website is my first official site that will take you through my journey of being a web designer. You will get a chance to explore all my work within my web design class during my fall of 2024 school year.  Feel free to get to know me first with the bio tab, then take a look at all my work up until my final project! Hope you enjoy it!
